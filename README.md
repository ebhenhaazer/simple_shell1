#simple_shell
A simple Unix shell implementation in C, created by Elihah Mwathi and Jude Kimathi

This project is quite fun and interesting as we put all we learnt to the test in order to improve our proggramming skills. The simple shell is a basic command line interface that allows us to interact with our computers through entering commands.

#Getting started
To get started, simply clone this repo and compile the code. Once you have assertained that the code works, simply run your shell and start entering commands.

#Having trouble?
Do not be discouraged. There are plenty of resources on the internet with all the bells and whistles to help with your journey in creating a simple shell. Remember that no way is easy and you must take the initiative to learn.

#Conclusion
THANK YOU SO MUCH for visiting this repository!!
We hope that you will find some guidance and understand what is going on with the code.
Happy coding!
